# WHAT I LEARNED - Jan 6, 2026

## THE FUCK-UP

I wasted hours trying to add local /api routes to the FRONTEND project, when:
- The frontend is STATIC HTML ONLY (no API capability)
- The BACKEND already existed and was working (h2s-backend.vercel.app)
- Bundles.html was ALREADY using h2s-backend correctly
- I just needed to copy what bundles.html does

## WHAT CHANGED

1. DELETED /app directory (8,883 lines of useless duplicate code)
2. Changed portal.html from '/api' to 'https://h2s-backend.vercel.app/api'
3. Created ARCHITECTURE_TRUTH.md (explains the 2-project system)
4. Created DEPLOYMENT_RULES.md (prevents repeat mistakes)

## HOW TO PREVENT THIS SHIT AGAIN

### RULE #1: THERE ARE ONLY 2 PROJECTS
- h2s-bundles-frontend (HTML files)
- h2s-backend (API endpoints)

### RULE #2: NEVER CREATE DIRECTORIES AT ROOT
- Only edit /frontend or /backend
- If you see /app, /api, tsconfig.json at root  DELETE THEM

### RULE #3: CHECK BUNDLES.HTML FIRST
- Bundles.html is the reference implementation
- If it works for bundles, copy it for portal
- Don't invent new architecture

### RULE #4: RUN TESTS BEFORE SAYING 'DONE'
See DEPLOYMENT_RULES.md for verification commands

## VERIFICATION (Just Ran - All Passed)
 Portal loads at portal.home2smart.com/portal
 Portal uses h2s-backend.vercel.app/api
 All 4 key API endpoints respond (login, jobs, me, signup)
 Routing redirects working (/bundles  /portal)

## THE SYSTEM IS NOW LIVE AND WORKING

You can:
- Sign up new techs
- Login to portal
- View jobs
- Accept/decline offers
- All portal features operational
